        ### Overview
        This chat interface helps you formulate and solve optimization problems through conversation. 
        The system uses multiple AI agents:
        
        1. **Consultant**: Helps understand your problem and formulate it mathematically
        2. **Coder**: Writes the optimization model code
        3. **CodeCritic**: Reviews the code for accuracy
        4. **Checker**: Verifies code execution
        
        #### How it works:
        1. First, you'll discuss your problem with the Consultant
        2. Once the problem is well-defined, the Coder will implement it
        3. The CodeCritic will review the implementation
        4. Finally, the code will be executed and checked
        
        #### Getting Started:
        1. Enter your OpenAI API key below
        2. Start by describing your optimization problem
        3. Follow the Consultant's questions to fully define the problem

        I have 2 warehouse facilities and I need to know how to best utilize the space to achieve the lowest cost. Each facility has indoor and outdoor storage bins.
        Facility 1 has 100,000 sq ft of indoor storage space and 100,000 sq ft of outdoor storage space.
        Facility 2 has 75,000 sq ft of indoor storage space and 200,000 sq ft of outdoor storage space.
        There are three different types of products: product A, product B, and product C. Product A must be stored indoor, either in an indoor on-ground storage bin or an indoor rack storage bin. A single storage bin can hold 10 of product A. Products B and C can be stored either indoor or outdoor, either in an indoor on-ground storage bin, an indoor rack storage bin, or outdoor on-ground storage bin. A single storage bin can hold 3 of product B. Product C requires 2 bins per product (0.5 units per bin).
        Storage bins can be located either directly on the ground, or on racks. Storage bins on the ground consume 32 sq ft each. Storage racks also consume 32 sq ft each but hold 3 storage bins each.
        Facility 1 currently has 2,000 indoor storage racks (equating to 6,000 storage bins consuming 64,000 sq ft of indoor space), 1,125 indoor on-ground storage bins (equating to 1,125 storage bins consuming 36,000 sq ft), and 3,125 outdoor on-ground storage bins (equating to 3,125 storage bins consuming 100,000 sq ft of outdoor space).
        Facility 2 currently has 2,343 indoor on-ground storage bins (equating to 2,343 storage bins consuming 75,000 sq ft of indoor space), and 6,250 outdoor on-ground storage bins (equating to 6,250 storage bins consuming 200,000 sq ft of outdoor space).
        Storage racks can be added to indoor facilities to expand storage bin capacity. It costs 3,000 per storage rack to add new racks. Storage racks can only be added indoor. For each storage rack added, an indoor on-ground storage bin must be removed. On-ground storage bins have no cost. It does not cost money to remove storage racks or on-ground storage bins.
        There must be enough storage space to hold at least 90,000 units of product A, 10,000 units of product B, and 1,000 units of product C.
        I need to know how many storage racks to add to or remove from each facility, how much of each product to store in each facility, and how many bins by type (indoor on-ground, indoor rack, or outdoor on-ground) to allocate to each product in each facility such that total cost will be minimized.
        Be sure to specify that indoor racks, indoor on-ground storage, and outdoor on-ground storage locations all consume 32sq ft. However, indoor racks hold 3 bins while on-ground storage locations only hold 1 bin.

        1. the limit is only constrained by the available indoor space once bins are removed for rack installation
        1.	the main focus is simply to minimize the cost of adding racks while meeting the product storage requirements
        Be sure to specify that indoor racks consume 32 sq ft and hold 3 bins while outdoor on-ground and indoor on-ground locations consume 32 sq ft and hold 1 bin. Also, state the number of units per bin for each product.
